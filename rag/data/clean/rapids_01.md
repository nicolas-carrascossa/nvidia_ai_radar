GPU Accelerated Data Science

[New: cuML now accelerates scikit-learn](https://rapids.ai/cuml-accel) [New: Polars GPU Engine](https://rapids.ai/polars-gpu-engine) [cuDF now pre-installed in Google Colab](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rapids-cudf-instantly-accelerates-pandas-up-to-50x-on-google-colab/?ncid=em-news-294101) [Vector Search now with cuVS](https://rapids.ai/cuvs) [RAPIDS 26.06 Released](https://docs.rapids.ai/install#selector)

## What is RAPIDS

RAPIDS provides unmatched speed with familiar APIs that match the most popular PyData libraries.
Built on state-of-the-art foundations like [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), it unlocks the speed of GPUs with code you already know.

## Why Use RAPIDS

RAPIDS allows fluid, creative interaction with data for everyone from BI users to AI researchers
on the
cutting edge. GPU acceleration means less time and less cost moving data and training models. [Jump to RAPIDS Use Cases](https://rapids.ai/learn-more/#use-cases)

## Open Source Ecosystem

RAPIDS is Open Source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rapidsai).
Our mission is to empower and advance the open-source GPU data science data engineering
ecosystem. [Jump to RAPIDS GitHub](https://github.com/rapidsai)
